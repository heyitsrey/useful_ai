This is a small personal collection of useful prompts and tips for using AI tools in programming. 
The goal is to make it easier and faster to work productively with AI like ChatGPT, GitHub Copilot, or other language models.

## Contents

The repository includes two simple text files:

- `Prompts` – A list of helpful prompts you can use or adapt when working with AI for coding tasks.
- `Tips` – A set of short tips and tricks that have proven useful when using AI in the development process.

## Use Cases

Some examples of when this might come in handy:

- You want to write better prompts, faster.
- You're new to AI-assisted coding and looking for a starting point.
- You need inspiration on how to integrate AI into your workflow effectively.
